							Abstraction
ğŸ‘€ Abstraction Is A  Process Of Hiding The Implementation From The User.
ğŸ‘€ Only The functionality Will Be Provided To The User.
ğŸ‘€ In Other Words, The User Will Have 
ğŸ‘€ The Information On What The Object Does Instead Of How It Dose It.
ğŸ‘€ In Java, abstraction is accomplished using Abstract classes and interfaces
ğŸ‘€ it can only be extended 
ğŸ‘€ It's only meant to be a parent of another class 
ğŸ‘€ cannot be instantiated -  means we can't create an object to Abstract class
